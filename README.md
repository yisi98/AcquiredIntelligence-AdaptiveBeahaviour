# AcquiredIntelligence&AdaptiveBeahaviour
 
The course covers topics in cybernetics, neural networks, evolution and genetic algorithms, dynamical systems theory (emergence, chaos) as well as modern approaches to robotics, both real and in simulation.

PDF is the reports on my findings in the research
Codes for the optimisation and simulated robots are included.

I compared the performance of hillclimbing algorithm with the biologically inspired genetic algorithms and evolutionary algorithms. Codes were coded by myself and performances plotted in a detailed report.
